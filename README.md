# Laravel Multilingual Architecture

A Multilingual Architecture with Laravel 5.6 PHP Framework. The Demo contains a simple multilingual blogging system with SEO meta-data generation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

See: <br />
https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/installation#server-requirements


### Installing

Create your .env file from .env.example. <br />
Set-up the database connections.

Generate the application's APP_KEY:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

And run migrations:

```
php artisan migrate
```

Run the database seeder in case you need dummy data. <br />
Generated by Faker - https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker.

```
php artisan db:seed
```

Run composer:

```
composer update
```


## The Architecture

* **Following the general MVC pattern.** <br />
The **Models** can be found in the app/Models/ folder.

Defined Service Providers:
* App\Providers\PostServiceProvider
* App\Providers\SeoServiceProvider

The **Service** Interfaces and their implementations can be found in the app/Services/ folder <br />
The **Controllers** can be found in the app/Http/Controllers/ folder. <br />
The **Views** can be found in the resources/views/ folder.


* **Routing**
The Public Web Routes are defined in the routes/web/web.php file. <br />
The Authorized Web Routes are defined in the routes/web/admin.php file. <br />
See available routes:

```
php artisan route:list
```


* **Localization**
The default locales are 'hu' and 'en'. <br />
To enable other locales change the supportedLocales key in the config file laravellocalization.php


* **Compiling Assets**
Webpack is used.

See: <br />
https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/mix

For development (Run all Mix tasks)

```
npm run dev
```

For production (Run all Mix tasks and minify output)

```
npm run production
```


* **Admin Page**
To see the Admin Page use route: /login <br />
And the dummy user credentials (after db:seed): <br />
user: admin@test.com <br />
password: admin

## Running the tests

Set-up a test database trough the env variable DB_TEST_DATABASE. <br />
Run migration on the test database:

```
php artisan migrate --database=testing
```

Run unit tests with PHP Unit:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

For writing unit tests see example: Tests\Unit\PostTest.php
